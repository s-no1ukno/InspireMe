# Quote Site Outline and Notes

## Resources

- [Quotes API](https://quotes.rest/)

## What It Is

I want to build a small front end app that will contact the Quotes API for a random positive and inspirational quote and display it on the page.  I need to do this to boost my understanding of API calls, as well as do something nice for my wife, who would love to be able to look at a personalized app to feel a little better during the day.

## Goals
---
- [ ] 2 pages
  - Landing page
  - App Page
- [ ] ~~Fully Front End - zero backend code~~
  - ~~will this work with the API?~~
  - ~~do I need secret keys?~~
  - I don't think I can actually do a zero backend developement if I want there to be the note-pass ability

### Landing Page

- [ ] Landing Page has a pretty random peaceful image upon startup

#### Stretch Goal
- [ ] Has a spot for a message from other party of pair
  - Kinda want this to be update-able from other party to myself, and from myself to other party
  - cute little note upon startup

### App Page

- [ ] Need to be able to update the GET request with user input to receive a random quote within a given category
  - [ ] User can update category
  - [ ] Submit button

- [ ] Separate area for submitting note to other party's home page
  - different module??
  - updated with submit button
